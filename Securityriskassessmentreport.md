## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Password policies, Multifactor authentication (MFA)	and Firewall maintenance	

## Part 2: Explain your recommendations

The selected practices were based on the risk analysis and identified vulnerabilities. The three chosen hardening practices aim to address the gaps found in the assessment, reinforcing the organization's security in the following ways:

1. Password policies: Implementing strong password policies is essential to prevent employees from sharing passwords or using weak credentials. These policies should include requirements for complex, unique passwords and restrict the use of default credentials, such as the administrator password for the database.

2. Multifactor authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than one form of authentication (e.g., password and phone verification). This helps prevent brute force attacks and unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.

3. Firewall maintenance: Establishing proper firewall rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic is critical to block unauthorized access and malicious traffic. Regular maintenance ensures these rules are updated as new threats arise, providing ongoing network protection.

These measures should be rigorously implemented and reviewed frequently to ensure that the network security remains up-to-date and in line with best practices.
